# Facial Demographics
Our work on [facial demographics](https://github.com/ShreyanshJoshi/Facial-Demographics-using-CNN) was extended for another 6 weeks, wherein me and [Vikas Sheoran](https://github.com/kkviks) worked on a research paper. The paper was accepted in CVIP 2020 and has been published by Springer CCIS (Communications in Computer and Information Science series), Singapore.

Publication: [Age and Gender Prediction using Deep CNNs and Transfer Learning](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-16-1092-9_25)

## Dataset

[UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) - dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.
